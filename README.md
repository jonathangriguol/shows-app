# About the demo :)

This technical test was boostraped with create-react-app which provides a full featured scaffold for a scalable \
project from scratch. ‚úîÔ∏è
I used a bunch of tools like Material-UI to implement a fancy and responsive layout. Storybook to get components well documented and
easy to test in isolation mode.
I implemented a API helper and a "service" layer to communicate with the API rest using Axios.
I used the "styledComponent" concept from Material-UI to stylize some components.
React Router to manage the navigation, and Jest for unit testin.. I just did a few relevant cases because a lack of time :'(

## Getting Started with 
üíØ In the project directory, you must run:

### `npm i`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

üèÅ Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run storybook`

‚ö° Run this command to test functional components in isolation mode. Storybook also works perfectly as a documentation tool for Components!

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

**IMPORTANT!:** If you want to build and run the website from your local directory, you must to add this on the package.json:

### `"homepage": "your-app-directory/build/",`

üì¶ Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
